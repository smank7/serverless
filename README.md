### Serverless Google Cloud Function with Node.js

This repository contains a serverless application built using Google Cloud Functions and the Node.js runtime. The application is designed to run as a serverless function on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It demonstrates how to build and deploy a serverless API endpoint using Node.js with Google Cloud Functions.

### Overview

The serverless application architecture includes the following components:

- **Google Cloud Functions:** Serverless functions that are triggered by HTTP requests.
- **Node.js Application:** RESTful API endpoints implemented using Node.js and Express.js (optional for routing).
- **Event Handling:** Logic to handle incoming HTTP requests, process data, and generate responses.
